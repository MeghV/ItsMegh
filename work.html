				<h3>My current work:</h3>

				<ul class="work">
					<li id="suw"><h4 class="highlight">Co-President, Startup UW</h4>
					<h5>February 2013 - Present</h5>
					<p>I'm the Co-President/Co-Founder of Startup UW - the University of Washington's largest entrepreneurship and startup club. It's like my baby. I, along with the exec team, have worked on increasing this club's membership by a hundredfold (from zero) and have also held events aimed at helping students from all majors practice their passions, create teams, and get the resources to start their own companies. Pretty cool stuff. Check out the website (I made it in Wordpress)!</p>
					</li>

					<li><h4 class="highlight">Media Director, Indian Student Association</h4>
					<h5>June 2013 - Present</h5>
					<p>Culture is a pretty large part of my life - exploring and getting involved with cultural organizations at the UW have really helped me rediscover my Indian side. As the Media Director for ISA, I create flyers and posters for all of our events and also manage the website. </p>
				</ul>

				<h3>Recent experience:</h3>
				<ul class="work">
					<li><h4 class="highlight">Marketing and Product Research Intern, Yabbly</h4>
					<h5>February 2013 - August 2013</h5>
					<p>Yabbly is a Seattle-based startup focused on solving one big problem: buyer's remorse. Through a product based Q&amp;A platform, users can find the best products for their specific needs, right from other people who have bought similar products in similar situations. I jumped in when Yabbly had a few hundred users and managed their community-facing pages, figuring out the best way to gain users, and engaged users at that. Along with that, I helped develop and experiment with user acquistion stratgies. Product development was also something I got to work on - I interviewed users and designed frameworks for the Yabbly "Tags" feature, essentially LinkedIn-style endorsements for products. Fun fun!</p>
					</li>
					<hr>
					<li><h4 class="highlight">Marketing Apprentice, Microsoft's Xbox Consumer Engagement team</h4>
					<h5>August 2011 - August 2012</h5>
					<p>I had the opportunity to work at Microsoft as a marketing intern way back in the day when I was a senior in high school (I was literally 15)! Working in Xbox Consumer Engagement, I had the opportunity to do competitive research between the Xbox Newsletter and other entertainment brands, analysis on what types of content recieved the highest clickthrough rates, and how the Xbox Newsletter could do a better job with content to engage different user segments. The cherry on top was that I managed the Xbox Newsletter for the month of August 2012 - talking with Xbox's design agency, negotiating with stakeholders, and dealing with content placement and deadlines. Also the biggest company I've worked at!</p>
